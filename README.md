# Sam Mabeza

Computer Science student and aspiring systems librarian with interests in low-level programming, narrative systems, and information architecture. I build tools that bridge the gap between technology and knowledge preservation.

## Current Focus
- Completing [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) â€” foundational computer science with C
- Learning Kotlin for high school robotics team
- Preparing for AP Computer Science A (Java) and AP Statistics
- Developing proficiency with Git and version control

## Projects

### [Library Inventory Tracker](https://github.com/sammabeza/library-inventory)
Terminal-based inventory management system for library collections. Implements case-insensitive duplicate detection, formatted reporting, and persistent data storage for tracking books, authors, and circulation data.

Terminal application for managing book reviews with star ratings and written feedback. Features automatic file persistence and review browsing functionality.

### [The Art of Theft *(or, The Art Thief)*](https://github.com/sammabeza/art-thief)
Terminal-based art heist sim where players build a criminal reputation through strategic museum thefts. Built in C to explore game design, decision trees, and narrative mechanics. Inspired by The Art Thief by Michael Finkel.
